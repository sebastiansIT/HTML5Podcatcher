HTML5Podcatcher
===============

A clientsite and offline HTML 5 Podcast Player

This is a project to evaluate a lot of HTML5 API's. In Example "DOM Storage", "Fils System API" and "Audio API".

I planed the following Steps:
1. Local Playlist
	a. Read/Write a playlist from a local storage (DOM Storage)
	b. Render this playlist
	c. Play a entry on click
2. Download Podcasts
	a. Download the podcasts from the playlist to a local storage (File System API)
	b. Play the downloaded podcasts from the local storage
3. Syncronise Playlist
	a. Load a Atom/RSS feed and actualise the playlist with the feed entries
